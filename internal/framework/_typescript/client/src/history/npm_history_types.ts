/******************************************************************************

This file is a condensed, comment-stripped, and prefixed-type version of
npm:history's index.d.ts file as of v5.3.0. npm:history is licensed under the
MIT license. It is used under the hood by river.now/client.

The npm:history repository is located at: https://github.com/remix-run/history

It's only purpose is to re-export a minimal version of the types needed by
river.now/client's "getHistoryInstance" function, which simply returns an
instance of npm:history's BrowserHistory.
