# Code of Conduct

## Prohibited Activities

All natural persons, bots, agents, and other entities interacting with this
project in any way shall refrain from the following prohibited activities:

1. Spamming.
1. Trolling.
1. Harassing any natural person.
1. Engaging in excessive displays of vulgarity.
1. Doxxing or otherwise violating the reasonably expected privacy of any natural
   person (regardless of whether the victim is a community member).
1. Behaving as though anyone other than the project's leadership possesses the
   right to have a proposed contribution merged. Contributions are reviewed,
   accepted, and merged solely at the discretion of the maintainers and,
   ultimately, the project's leadership. Contributions may be ignored or closed
   without comment if they are implicitly or explicitly disrespectful of the
   time of others.
1. Demanding that the project or any community member make, take, or contemplate
   any particular political, ethical, social, or religious statement, stance, or
   action of any kind.

## Enforcement

The maintainers shall use reasonable efforts to enforce this Code of Conduct as
may seem reasonably appropriate to them on a case-by-base basis. This may
include warnings, blocking, banning, deletion of materials, or any other legally
permitted actions.

Warnings are not guaranteed; sufficiently blatant violations may result in
immediate permanent bans from official digital or physical spaces.

If any maintainer fails to use good faith in the interpretation or enforcement
of this Code of Conduct, such maintainer's privileges may be revoked by the
project's leadership.

## Modifications

This Code of Conduct may be modified at any time by the project's leadership in
its sole discretion. The merging of any revisions by the project's leadership
into the main branch of the repository shall be considered notice thereof.
