## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-hwy@latest
```

## What is Hwy?

Hwy is a lot like NextJS or Remix, but it uses **_HTMX_** instead of React on the frontend.

Hwy lets you write **_React-style JSX_** in **_nested, file-based routes_**, with **_Remix-style actions and parallel loaders_**.

Page components are async, so you can even **_fetch data in JSX_** if you want to (just be careful with waterfalls).

The backend server is built on **_Hono_**, so you have access to a rich, growing ecosystem with lots of middleware and wonderful docs.

Hwy is **_100% server-rendered_**, but with the HTMX defaults Hwy sets up for you out of the box, your app still **_feels like an SPA_**.

Links and forms are automatically **_progressively enhanced_** thanks to HTMX's `hx-boost` feature. Just use normal anchor tags and traditional form attributes.

Because Hwy replaces the **_full page_** on transitions by default, everything stays **_simple_**. You don't have to return different components from different endpoints (unless you want to).

And best of all, **_anything you can do with Hono or HTMX, you can do with Hwy_**.

## Features

- Server-rendered JSX / TSX
- Nested, file-based routing
- Remix-style actions and parallel loaders
- Async page components
- Rich Hono middleware ecosystem
- 100% type-safe
- Server built on Hono
- Client built on HTMX
- Built-in critical CSS inlining
- Live browser refresh during development
- And more...

## Guiding Principles

- No speed limits
- Numerous off-ramps
- Smooth, safe roads
- Clear traffic signs

## Simple usage

Below is an example of a simple Hwy page. You'll notice it looks a lot like Remix, and you're right! Hwy is heavily inspired by Remix, but it uses HTMX instead of React.

```tsx
// src/pages/user/$user_id.page.tsx

import type { DataProps, PageProps } from "hwy";
import { UserProfile, getUser } from "./somewhere.js";

export async function loader({ params }: DataProps) {
  return await getUser(params.user_id);
}

export default async function ({ loaderData }: PageProps<typeof loader>) {
  return <UserProfile user={loaderData} />;
}
```

Or, if you prefer to fetch inside your components:

```tsx
export default async function ({ params }: PageProps) {
  const user = await getUser(params.user_id);

  return <UserProfile user={user} />;
}
```

## Get Started

If you want to dive right in, just open a terminal and run `npx create-hwy@latest` and follow the prompts.

If you'd prefer to read more first, take a peek at [our docs](https://hwy.dev/docs).

## Acknowledgements

Hwy's APIs are obviously inspired by Remix. If Remix didn't exist, Hwy likely wouldn't exist either. Hwy doesn't use any Remix code, but it still owes a big thanks to the Remix team (past and present) for their top-tier patterns design. If you're building something huge and important today, use Remix.
