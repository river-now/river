# Hwy

Hwy is a minimalist, Go-based Next.js alternative with nested routing.

## Project Goals

- Be boring
- Avoid feature bloat
- Be easy to debug and understand
- Keep dev and prod as identical as possible
- Build on stable, "lowest-common-denominator" primitives
- Be as tech-agnostic as possible
- Change as little as possible over time
- Avoid vendor-specific code
- Prefer dumb solutions over clever ones

## Quick Start

Coming soon.

For now – if you're adventurous – you can peek into the `projects` folder in our monorepo for some usage examples.

## Project Status

Hwy is in alpha stage and is not recommended for use in production unless you
know what you're doing. All APIs are subject to change without notice, so if you
do decide to use Hwy, pin your versions, and be prepared to update your code
frequently.

Additionally, Hwy is not currently open for contributions. If you have a feature
request or bug report, please open an issue on GitHub.
