## Quick Start

```sh
npm create river@latest
```

## What is River?

River is a lot like NextJS or Remix, but it uses Go on the backend, with your
choice of **_React_**, **_Solid_**, or **_Preact_** on the frontend.

It has **_nested routing_**, **_type-safe server actions_**,
**_parallel-executed route loaders_**, and much, much more.

It's deeply integrated with **_Vite_** to give you full **_hot module
reloading_** at dev-time.

## Get Started

If you want to dive right in, just open a terminal and run
`npm create river@latest` and follow the prompts.

If you'd prefer to read more first, take a peek at
[our docs](https://river.now/docs).

## Disclaimer

While River's technology is quite stable and has been used in anger in
production settings, our APIs are still evolving, and we plan to stay subâ€“1.0
until we feel we have collected all the feedback we need to make sure we can
support our APIs for years to come. Our general strategy is to delay a 1.0
release for long enough to be sure we won't need a lot of API churn moving
forward.
