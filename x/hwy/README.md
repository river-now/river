# Hwy

<img src="hwy-banner.webp" alt="Hwy logo banner">

Hwy is a fullstack web framework for driving a React, Preact, or Solid frontend
with a Go backend. Includes end-to-end typesafety, file-based nested UI routing,
and much more.

## Project Goals

- Be boring
- Avoid feature bloat
- Be easy to debug and understand
- Keep dev and prod as identical as possible
- Build on stable, "lowest-common-denominator" primitives
- Be as tech-agnostic as possible
- Change as little as possible over time
- Avoid vendor-specific code
- Prefer dumb solutions over clever ones

## Project Status

Hwy is in alpha stage and is not recommended for use in production unless you
know what you're doing. All APIs are subject to change without notice, so if you
do decide to use Hwy, pin your versions, and be prepared to update your code
frequently.
